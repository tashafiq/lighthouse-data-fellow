## Lighthouse Data Fellow application

### Applicant: Tahmeed Shafiq

This repo is a part of my applicated for Lighthouse Reports' 2024 fellowship application cycle. It contains two examples of my work for both
journalism and research projects:

1. An email scraper used as part of my 2023 tenant rights' investigation for [The Local](https://thelocal.to/landlord-tenant-board-wait-times/). The file is [scrape-latest](https://github.com/tashafiq/lighthouse-data-fellow/blob/00808cef2d812635587ea983e08726fa4d27948f/scrape-latest.py).
2. An optimised version of a classic 1978 Monte Carlo algorithm developed by [Witten and Sandler](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.27.5686) for modeling [diffusion-limited aggregation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/9789812832061_0016), created for a fourth-year undergraduate physics course. This model is split across three files: [Functions](https://github.com/tashafiq/lighthouse-data-fellow/blob/3255d6b22a58200a828bb07750bbf7ee8a94ba15/Functions.py), [Optimized Model](https://github.com/tashafiq/lighthouse-data-fellow/blob/3255d6b22a58200a828bb07750bbf7ee8a94ba15/Optimizied%20Model.py), [3D Model](https://github.com/tashafiq/lighthouse-data-fellow/blob/3255d6b22a58200a828bb07750bbf7ee8a94ba15/3D%20Model.py).
